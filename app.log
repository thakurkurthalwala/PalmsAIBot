INFO:root:Session ID: 8b5a4e08-1c2f-4134-850b-fc0a775acfcb, AI Response: SKU stands for **Stock Keeping Unit**.  

Think of it as a unique identifier for each product in your inventory. It helps businesses keep track of their stock and manage sales, orders, and deliveries efficiently. 


Here's why SKUs are important:

* **Easy identification:** Each SKU has a specific code that makes it easy to identify and locate the product.
* **Inventory management:**  SKUs help you track how much of each product you have in stock, allowing for accurate inventory counts and reordering. 
* **Sales & orders:** When processing sales or placing orders, SKUs ensure the correct products are selected and accounted for.


Let me know if you'd like to learn more about SKUs!

INFO:root:Session ID: 8b5a4e08-1c2f-4134-850b-fc0a775acfcb, AI Response: GRN stands for **Goods Receipt Note**. 

It's a document used in businesses to record the receipt of goods from suppliers or vendors. 

Here's what it typically involves:

* **Details of the goods:** The GRN lists the specific items received, including their quantity, description, and any other relevant information.
* **Supplier details:**  The GRN includes information about the supplier who delivered the goods (name, contact info, etc.). 
* **Receiving date & time:** This helps track when the goods were received.
* **Verification process:** The GRN often involves a verification process to ensure that the goods received match the order and are in good condition.


Do you have any other questions about GRNs or inventory management?  

INFO:root:Session ID: None, User Query: Hi, Model: phi3:mini
INFO:root:Session ID: 8b5a4e08-1c2f-4134-850b-fc0a775acfcb, AI Response: A GRN stands for **Goods Received Note**. It is a document used in businesses when goods arrive at the warehouse or distribution center, and it serves as proof that these items have been received safely from suppliers. Here's what you need to know about GRN:

* **Verification of Delivery:** A GRN confirms that all ordered products are present upon delivery without any damage. It helps in verifying the accuracy of shipments against purchase orders and packing slips. 
* **Inventory Update:** Once a GRN is issued, it triggers an update to inventory records as goods have been received into stock. This ensures that your business's inventory levels are always current.
* **Accountability & Auditing:** AGRN serves as evidence for accounting purposes and can be used during audits or inspections by suppliers, customers, or regulatory bodies to confirm the receipt of goods against invoices. 

If you need assistance with creating a GRN form or have any questions about its process within your business operations, feel free to ask!

INFO:root:Session ID: 424aea19-d500-4691-9d71-9e38035c2331, AI Response: Yes, a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a unique identifier assigned by a seller or manufacturer to each product and service for tracking purposes. It helps in managing inventory effectively as it provides detailed information such as the item's name, code, type, stock rotation rule, supplier details, storage unit of measure (UOM), billing UOM, ordering UOM, etc. SKUs are essential tools used by businesses to keep track of their products and manage them efficiently in various systems like PALMS or any other inventory management software.
INFO:root:Session ID: 424aea19-d500-4691-9d71-9e38035c2331, User Query: How ca we create an SKU ?, Model: phi3:mini
INFO:root:Session ID: 424aea19-d500-4691-9d71-9e38035c2331, AI Response: Creating a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) can be done through two methods: using the screen interface, or by uploading it via CSV file format in some systems like PALMS. Here's how you do both ways:

From Screen : Navigate to Setup \u2192 SKU and click on Create SKU button. Enter all required attributes such as item name, code, type (either 'Product', 'Service', or a combination of the two), stock rotation rule ('First In First Out' - FIFO, for example), supplier details if applicable, UOMs used in storage/billing and ordering processes among others. Once all necessary information is entered accurately, click on Save to create your SKU.

Through CSV upload : Prepare a .csv file containing the required attributes of an item as per system requirements (like Item Name, Code etc.). Upload this csv into Setup \u2192 SKU and select 'Create from CSV'. The software will then populate these details in respective fields on your screen. Once all necessary information is entered accurately, click Save to create your SKU.

ANPR systems typically use cameras combined with software that can recognize characters on number plates from images or video feeds in real-time. This technology is often employed to monitor traffic flow, detect stolen vehicles, enforce parking regulations, manage access control at secure facilities and events, as well as for law enforcement purposes such as identifying wanted individuals or checking compliance with vehicle registration laws.
